## üîÑ Framework Alignment Assessment

### ‚úÖ Strengths: Well-Aligned Areas

#### 1. Hierarchical Prompt Structure
**Library Design**: Epic ‚Üí Feature ‚Üí Story hierarchy  
**Framework Implementation**: Perfect alignment with spec-driven development  
**Evidence**: Prompts explicitly reference parent specifications (e.g., "under epic E001", "under feature F005")

#### 2. Banking Domain Intelligence
**Library Design**: Banking-specific prompts with domain context  
**Framework Implementation**: Banking context detection and classification working  
**Evidence**: Prompts include product types, compliance requirements, technical specifications

#### 3. Spec-Driven Development Support
**Library Design**: Clear progression from requirements to implementation  
**Framework Implementation**: Enforced spec-first workflow with intelligent routing  
**Evidence**: Examples show epic creation before features, features before stories

#### 4. Compliance Integration
**Library Design**: Dedicated compliance prompts and regulatory considerations  
**Framework Implementation**: Compliance requirement mapping and validation  
**Evidence**: Compliance stories explicitly linked to features and regulations

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas Requiring Enhancement

#### 1. **Code Generation Prompt Gaps**
**Library Gap**: Limited code implementation prompts  
**Framework Capability**: Advanced code generation with banking intelligence  
**Recommendation**: Expand code generation prompts to leverage CodeAgent capabilities

**Missing Prompt Categories:**
```
# Current library lacks these patterns:
"Implement [banking_feature] API with [security_requirements]"
"Generate [database_schema] for [banking_product] with [compliance]"
"Build [frontend_component] for [customer_experience] with [accessibility]"
"Create [integration_code] between [system_a] and [system_b]"
```

#### 2. **Spec-Driven Workflow Prompts**
**Library Gap**: No explicit spec-driven workflow prompts  
**Framework Capability**: Intelligent routing based on specification availability  
**Recommendation**: Add prompts that explicitly demonstrate spec-driven patterns

**Needed Prompt Patterns:**
```
# Spec-driven workflow examples:
"Create complete workflow from epic to code for [banking_product]"
"Implement [feature] based on existing specifications"
"Generate specifications then implement [banking_capability]"
```

#### 3. **LangGraph Orchestration Prompts**
**Library Gap**: No orchestration-specific prompts  
**Framework Capability**: Multi-agent coordination and state management  
**Recommendation**: Add prompts that leverage orchestration capabilities

**Missing Orchestration Patterns:**
```
# Multi-agent workflow prompts:
"Orchestrate complete implementation of [banking_system]"
"Coordinate specification creation and validation for [product]"
"Manage end-to-end workflow for [compliance_requirement]"
```
