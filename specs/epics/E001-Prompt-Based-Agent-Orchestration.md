# Epic: Prompt-Based Agent Orchestration Hub
**ID:** E001  
**Objective:** Build an orchestration layer that translates natural-language prompts into structured product development actions for the MyBank repository.  
**Owner:** Vrushali Date  
**Linked Features:** F001, F002  

### Business Context
This epic enables "Prompt to Product" — the transformation of human intent, expressed as a prompt, into real, testable, and deployable product features.  
The orchestration layer connects GitHub Copilot Agent Mode and MCP in VSCode to enable context-aware AI workflows.

### Success Criteria
- Developer can describe a feature or change in natural language.
- The system automatically generates or updates epics, features, and stories.
- End-to-end flow: **Prompt → Spec → Code → Commit → Deploy**.
