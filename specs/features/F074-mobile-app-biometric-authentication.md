**Product Type:** Digital Banking Security  
**Owner:** vrushalisarfare  
**Assigned To:** vrushalisarfare  
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** In Progress  
**Linked Stories:** TBD  

## Goal
Implement advanced biometric authentication for mobile banking app using fingerprint scanning and facial recognition to enhance security and user experience while meeting banking compliance requirements.

## Business Value
- **Enhanced Security**: Reduce account takeover fraud by 85%
- **Improved UX**: Eliminate password fatigue, reduce login time by 70%
- **Compliance**: Meet PCI-DSS and FFIEC authentication guidelines
- **Cost Reduction**: Reduce password reset support tickets by 60%
- **Customer Retention**: Increase app engagement by 40%

## Technical Requirements

### Biometric Capabilities
- **Fingerprint Authentication**: TouchID/FingerprintManager integration
- **Face Recognition**: FaceID/ML Kit face detection
- **Liveness Detection**: Anti-spoofing measures
- **Fallback Options**: PIN, pattern, or password backup

### Security Standards
- **Encryption**: Biometric templates encrypted at rest
- **Local Storage**: Templates stored in secure enclave/keystore
- **API Integration**: Secure authentication with banking APIs
- **Audit Logging**: Track all authentication attempts

### Performance Requirements
- Authentication response time: < 2 seconds
- Accuracy rate: > 99.5% for enrolled users
- False acceptance rate: < 0.01%
- Support for 10+ concurrent authentications

### Platform Support
