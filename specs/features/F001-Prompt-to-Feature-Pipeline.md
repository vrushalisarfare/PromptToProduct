# Feature: Prompt-to-Feature Generation Pipeline
**ID:** F001  
**Epic:** E001  
**Linked Stories:** S001, S002  

### Goal
Create an AI pipeline that interprets developer prompts in VSCode and generates corresponding specs (epic, feature, or story) directly linked to the MyBank repository.

### Technical Requirements
- Integration with MCP Server for GitHub operations.
- Use Copilot Agent Mode for interpreting and generating structured specs.
- Support for traceability: each spec linked hierarchically (epic → feature → story).

### Example Prompt
> "Create a feature to add transaction anomaly detection in MyBank using Python."

Expected outcome:
- New feature spec generated.
- Linked story for code implementation created.
- Auto-commit via MCP.
