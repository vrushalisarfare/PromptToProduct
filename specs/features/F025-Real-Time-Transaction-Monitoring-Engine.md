# Feature: Real-Time Transaction Monitoring Engine

**ID:** F025  
**Epic:** E025 - AI-Powered Fraud Detection System  
**Objective:** Implement real-time transaction monitoring with AI-powered risk scoring  
**Owner:** Vrushali Sarfare  
**Assigned To:** TBD  
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Ready for Development  

## Overview
Develop a real-time transaction monitoring engine that processes payment transactions as they occur, applying machine learning models to assess fraud risk and trigger appropriate actions based on risk scores.

## Business Requirements
- Process transactions in real-time with <100ms latency
- Score transactions using AI/ML models for fraud probability
- Integrate with existing payment processing infrastructure
- Support multiple payment channels (cards, mobile, online)
- Provide configurable risk thresholds and actions
- Maintain audit trail for compliance requirements

## Technical Requirements
### Core Components
- **Transaction Stream Processor**: High-throughput event processing
- **ML Model Service**: Real-time model inference and scoring
- **Rule Engine**: Configurable business rules and thresholds
- **Action Dispatcher**: Automatic responses based on risk scores
- **Audit Service**: Comprehensive transaction logging

### Integration Points
- Payment Gateway APIs
- Core Banking System
- Customer Database
- Fraud Analytics Dashboard
- Notification Service

### Performance Requirements
- Process 10,000+ transactions per second
- Sub-100ms response time for risk scoring
- 99.9% uptime availability
- Horizontal scalability for peak loads
- Real-time event streaming capabilities

## Banking Domain Context
- **Product Types**: Credit Cards, Debit Cards, Online Banking, Mobile Payments
- **Compliance Areas**: PCI-DSS, AML, KYC, GDPR
- **Risk Categories**: Transaction Fraud, Account Takeover, Card Skimming
- **Regulatory Requirements**: Real-time monitoring, suspicious activity reporting

## User Stories
### Primary Users
- **Fraud Analysts**: Monitor high-risk transactions and investigate alerts
- **Customers**: Receive real-time fraud notifications and verification requests
- **Compliance Officers**: Access audit trails and regulatory reports
- **System Administrators**: Monitor system performance and model accuracy

### Key User Stories
1. As a fraud analyst, I want to see high-risk transactions flagged in real-time
2. As a customer, I want to receive immediate alerts for suspicious transactions
3. As a compliance officer, I need detailed audit logs for regulatory reporting
4. As a system admin, I want to monitor ML model performance and accuracy
