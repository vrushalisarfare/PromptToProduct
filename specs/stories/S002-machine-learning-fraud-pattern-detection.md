# User Story: Machine Learning Fraud Pattern Detection
**ID:** S002  
**Feature:** F003 - Credit Card Fraud Detection  
**Epic:** E003 - Credit Card Fraud Detection  

### User Story
As a **data scientist**, I want to **implement machine learning models for fraud pattern detection** so that I can **automatically identify suspicious transaction patterns and improve fraud detection accuracy**.

### Acceptance Criteria
- **AC1**: ML models achieve 95% fraud detection rate with <2% false positive rate
- **AC2**: Models process transaction features (amount, location, time, merchant, customer behavior)
- **AC3**: Real-time scoring API returns fraud probability score within 50ms
- **AC4**: Models automatically retrain weekly using new transaction data and feedback
- **AC5**: A/B testing framework allows comparison of different ML algorithms
- **AC6**: Model performance monitoring dashboard tracks accuracy, precision, recall
- **AC7**: Feature importance analysis identifies key fraud indicators
- **AC8**: Data pipeline ensures PCI-compliant handling of sensitive payment data

### Tasks
1. **Data Engineering**
   - Build secure data pipeline for transaction and customer data ingestion
   - Implement feature engineering for transaction patterns and customer behavior
   - Create anonymized datasets for model training and testing
   - Set up MLOps pipeline for automated model deployment

2. **Model Development**
   - Develop ensemble models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks)
   - Implement behavioral analytics for customer spending patterns
   - Create geolocation-based fraud detection models
   - Build time-series analysis for transaction velocity detection

3. **Production Deployment**
   - Deploy models to real-time scoring infrastructure
   - Implement model versioning and rollback capabilities
   - Create automated retraining pipeline with performance validation
   - Build monitoring and alerting for model drift detection

### Definition of Done
- ML models successfully detect fraudulent transactions in production
- Real-time scoring API meets performance requirements (<50ms response)
- Model performance meets business requirements (95% detection, <2% false positives)
- Automated retraining pipeline validates and deploys improved models
- Comprehensive monitoring tracks model performance and data quality
