# User Story: Real-Time Fraud Alert Notifications

**ID:** S025-001  
**Feature:** F025 - Real-Time Transaction Monitoring Engine  
**Epic:** E025 - AI-Powered Fraud Detection System  
**Title:** Customer receives immediate fraud alerts for suspicious transactions  
**Priority:** High  
**Story Points:** 8  
**Status:** Ready for Development  

## User Story
**As a** bank customer  
**I want** to receive immediate notifications when suspicious transactions are detected on my account  
**So that** I can quickly verify legitimate transactions or report fraudulent activity to prevent financial losses  

## Acceptance Criteria

### Primary Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: When a transaction is flagged as high-risk (score >80%), customer receives notification within 30 seconds
- [ ] **AC2**: Notification includes transaction details: amount, merchant, location, time
- [ ] **AC3**: Customer can respond with "Approve" or "Block" action directly from notification
- [ ] **AC4**: If customer confirms fraud, account is automatically secured (card blocked, alerts sent)
- [ ] **AC5**: If customer confirms legitimate transaction, future similar transactions have reduced fraud score

### Notification Channels
- [ ] **AC6**: SMS notification sent to registered mobile number
- [ ] **AC7**: Push notification sent to mobile banking app (if installed)
- [ ] **AC8**: Email notification sent to registered email address
- [ ] **AC9**: In-app notification displayed in banking portal

### Response Handling
- [ ] **AC10**: Customer has 10 minutes to respond before auto-escalation to fraud team
- [ ] **AC11**: "Approve" response removes fraud flag and allows transaction to proceed
- [ ] **AC12**: "Block" response immediately blocks the transaction and triggers security measures
- [ ] **AC13**: No response triggers escalation to fraud analyst for manual review

### Security & Compliance
- [ ] **AC14**: All notifications include transaction verification code for security
- [ ] **AC15**: Customer responses are logged for audit trail
- [ ] **AC16**: PII is masked in notifications (partial card numbers, masked merchant names)
- [ ] **AC17**: Notifications comply with GDPR and banking privacy regulations

## Technical Requirements

### Integration Points
- Real-time transaction monitoring engine
- Customer notification service
- Mobile banking app
- SMS gateway service
- Email delivery service
- Fraud management system

### Performance Requirements
- Notification delivery within 30 seconds of fraud detection
- Support for 100,000+ concurrent notifications
- 99.9% notification delivery success rate
- Sub-5 second response processing time

### Data Requirements
- Customer contact preferences (SMS, email, push)
- Transaction details (amount, merchant, location, time)
- Fraud risk score and reasoning
- Customer response and timestamp

## Business Rules

### Notification Triggers
- High-risk transactions (fraud score >80%)
- Transactions from new devices or locations
- Large transactions above customer's typical spending
- Multiple transactions in short time periods
- Transactions outside normal spending patterns

### Response Logic
- **Immediate Approval**: Transaction proceeds, confidence score updated
- **Immediate Block**: Transaction declined, card temporarily blocked
- **No Response**: Escalated to fraud team after 10 minutes
- **Invalid Response**: Escalated to fraud team immediately

### Customer Preferences
- Customers can set notification thresholds ($100+, $500+, etc.)
- Customers can choose preferred notification channels
- Customers can set "do not disturb" hours for non-critical alerts
- Customers can whitelist trusted merchants for reduced monitoring

## Testing Scenarios

### Happy Path
1. High-risk transaction is processed
2. Customer receives notification within 30 seconds
3. Customer approves transaction via SMS/app
4. Transaction proceeds and system learns from approval

### Fraud Prevention
1. Fraudulent transaction is attempted
2. Customer receives immediate notification
3. Customer blocks transaction
4. Account is secured and fraud team is notified

### Edge Cases
- Customer phone is off/unreachable
- Multiple rapid-fire transactions
- Customer response during system maintenance
- Network connectivity issues

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implementation completed and unit tested
- [ ] Integration with notification services verified
- [ ] End-to-end testing with real transaction scenarios
- [ ] Performance testing meets latency requirements
- [ ] Security review and penetration testing completed
- [ ] Compliance review for regulatory requirements
- [ ] User acceptance testing with customer focus groups
- [ ] Documentation and runbooks created
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured
- [ ] Production deployment and rollout plan approved

## Banking Domain Context
- **Compliance Requirements**: PCI-DSS, GDPR, banking privacy regulations
- **Risk Management**: Fraud prevention, customer protection, financial loss mitigation
- **Customer Experience**: Real-time communication, easy response mechanisms
- **Operational Impact**: Reduced manual fraud investigation, improved response times

## Dependencies
- Real-time transaction monitoring engine (F025)
- Customer notification service infrastructure
- Mobile banking app notification system
- SMS and email delivery services
- Fraud management and case tracking system

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: High volume of false positive notifications annoy customers
  - **Mitigation**: Continuous ML model tuning to reduce false positives
- **Risk**: Notification delivery failures during critical fraud events
  - **Mitigation**: Multi-channel redundancy and fallback mechanisms
- **Risk**: Customer response system overwhelmed during peak periods
  - **Mitigation**: Auto-scaling infrastructure and rate limiting
