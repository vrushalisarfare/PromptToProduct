# Compliance Story: PCI DSS Requirements for Fraud Detection
**ID:** S003  
**Feature:** F003 - Credit Card Fraud Detection  
**Epic:** E003 - Credit Card Fraud Detection  

### Compliance Story
As a **compliance officer**, I want to **ensure the fraud detection system meets PCI DSS Level 1 requirements** so that I can **maintain certification for processing credit card data and avoid regulatory penalties**.

### Regulatory Requirements
- **PCI DSS 1.1**: Install and maintain firewall configuration to protect cardholder data
- **PCI DSS 2.1**: Never use vendor-supplied defaults for system passwords and security parameters
- **PCI DSS 3.4**: Render Primary Account Numbers (PAN) unreadable through encryption/tokenization
- **PCI DSS 4.1**: Use strong cryptography and security protocols for transmission of cardholder data
- **PCI DSS 6.5.10**: Implement proper input validation to prevent injection attacks
- **PCI DSS 8.2**: Implement strong authentication measures for system access
- **PCI DSS 10.2**: Implement automated audit trails for all access to cardholder data
- **PCI DSS 11.2**: Run quarterly vulnerability scans and annual penetration testing

### Acceptance Criteria
- **AC1**: All cardholder data encrypted using AES-256 encryption at rest and in transit
- **AC2**: PAN tokenization implemented with secure token vault separate from fraud system
- **AC3**: All system access requires multi-factor authentication and role-based permissions
- **AC4**: Comprehensive audit logging captures all data access and system changes
- **AC5**: Network segmentation isolates fraud detection system from other environments
- **AC6**: Vulnerability scanning and penetration testing demonstrate no critical findings
- **AC7**: Data retention policies automatically purge cardholder data per PCI requirements
- **AC8**: Incident response procedures tested and documented for data breach scenarios

### Tasks
1. **Security Implementation**
   - Implement end-to-end encryption for all cardholder data
   - Deploy tokenization service with secure key management
   - Configure network firewalls and intrusion detection systems
   - Set up multi-factor authentication for all system access

2. **Compliance Documentation**
   - Create security policies and procedures documentation
   - Develop incident response and breach notification procedures
   - Document data flow diagrams and security architecture
   - Prepare evidence collection for PCI DSS assessment

3. **Testing & Validation**
   - Conduct quarterly vulnerability assessments
   - Perform annual penetration testing
   - Test incident response procedures with tabletop exercises
   - Validate encryption and tokenization implementations

### Definition of Done
- PCI DSS Level 1 compliance assessment completed successfully
- All security controls implemented and tested
- Compliance documentation complete and approved
- Quarterly security testing schedule established
- Incident response procedures validated through testing
