📋 LangGraph: Generating specifications...
✅ Created epic: E030-create-specifications-implement.md
✅ Banking Context: True (Loan domain detected)
✅ Workflow Status: Completed successfully
```

**Framework Behavior Confirmed**:
- Correctly identified complex prompt requiring specification creation first
- Applied banking domain intelligence (loan origination)
- Generated proper epic specification structure
- Ready for subsequent feature and code implementation phases
