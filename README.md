# Prompt to Product

This repository follows a **Spec-Driven Development** approach, where each Epic, Feature, and Story is version-controlled and linked hierarchically.

### Structure
```
PromptToProduct/
├── specs/
│   ├── epics/
│   ├── features/
│   └── stories/
├── src/
│   └── MyBank/
└── .github/
    └── workflows/
```

Developers can interact with GitHub through VSCode MCP integration and use Copilot Agent Mode to generate new specs directly from prompts.
